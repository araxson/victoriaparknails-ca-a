I wanted to love this place because it’s close to me, they got me in last minute, the staff are lovely and the place is clean. Unfortunately, I received cuts in 3 spots during my gel set application. One from snipping a cuticle, one from filing the cuticle and one from a nail file shaping under my nail. The nails themselves came out very thick and chunky. The tips are also uneven and all look slightly different. My nails hurt SO much today (day after) which I have never experienced before :(

I had such amazing experiences with Sami! She’s incredibly talented and pays so much attention to detail every nail was shaped and polished to perfection. From the moment I walked in, she made me feel comfortable and pampered. She really listened to what I wanted and brought my vision to life beautifully. The space is clean, stylish, and so relaxing. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for flawless nails and a great overall vibe!

One star is generous - there have been numerous instances where I've visited Victoria Park Nails and have had to wait 20+ minutes for my scheduled appointment because they have taken walk ins while they had appointments scheduled.

When I went to attend my scheduled appointment today, I was told they were too busy, even though I had a scheduled appointment (which was several days in advanced) and they asked me to come back another time. I would not recommend coming here if you value your own time.

Book an appointment for a nail removal. They seemed confused when I came in for said appointment but still got me in quick. The tech helping me misunderstand and took all the polish off my acrylic nails and then said I was done. I was super confused as I wanted them completely off and also had two broken nails. She seemed super confused by my request and sanded down the acrylic nails so now my nails are in bad shape and I still have the acrylics on them! They are now chipping in areas and it honestly looks like I tried to remove them myself. She also tried to overcharge me for her misunderstanding. The whole ordeal took 45 mins(quoted 20 mins when booking). I've never really had nails so I didn't know any better but after looking it up, the tech was supposed to soak them and take them off in a more professional manner.
Will never go back.

Katie, we sincerely apologize for your disappointing experience. We clearly failed to meet your expectations regarding the acrylic removal process. There seems to have been a significant miscommunication, and we take full responsibility for that. You're right that proper acrylic removal involves soaking to minimize damage to natural nails. We'd like to offer you a complimentary service to properly remove the acrylics and a nail treatment to help repair any damage. Please contact us directly so we can make this right. We're reviewing our communication protocols to ensure this doesn't happen again.

Rita and Yvonne accommodated us so well, they were friendly and both did a lovely job. Very happy and well priced, would definitely come back if we lived locally. The salon was clean and light too.

Dealt with Evon. Originally for a manicure and pedicure for $60. She kept convincing me to do the shellac polish for $85, I felt coerced and said yes. As she was doing my pedicure, she hurt my toe nail and it caused it to bleed just a little bit and I felt the sting when the alcohol was being poured on my feet. During payment, she’s asking me to tip her, and I was like why would I tip you when you already up sold me with something I wasn’t really planning to get and the word you hurt my toe nail. Ugh. Not coming back here.

Lovely first-time experience at this salon. Anh gave me a thorough and professional spa pedi with regular polish as I requested. Unlike other reviewers, I like a quiet spa experience which Anh provided. We exchanged basic pleasantries before she directed her attention to my feet. I'm very happy with my soft feet and pretty toes, and will definitely return.

This salon is located on the 2nd floor so is not accessible. I like the online booking.

They filed my natural nail causing permanent pain and sensitivity.

I also asked for shellac in a natural color and they didn't have any, they only had fuchsias and peaches... what kind of nail salon doesn't have natural polish?
