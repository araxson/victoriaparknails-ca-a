    review: "I had such amazing experiences with Sami! She's incredibly talented and pays so much attention to detail every nail was shaped and polished to perfection. From the moment I walked in, she made me feel comfortable and pampered. She really listened to what I wanted and brought my vision to life beautifully. The space is clean, stylish, and so relaxing. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for flawless nails and a great overall vibe!",

    review: "My sister and I are visiting Calgary and we wanted to get our nails done, and didn't book. We wanted 2 spa pedicures, and a manicure. Rita and Yvonne accommodated us so well, they were friendly and both did a lovely job. Very happy and well priced, would definitely come back if we lived locally. The salon was clean and light too.",

    review: "Usually when I go to a salon the technician never seems to be interested. Not here. The staff is so sweet and is interested about their clients. They are respectful, clean, kind, super affordable and professional. I only went there to get acrylics and ended up with manicure, pedicure and eyebrow waxing because I didn't want to leave. Thank you Victoria Park nails! You guys are amazingðŸ˜Š",
